# Scrapy-Redis---Python
Apply a distributed system onto web-scraping

Scrapy.py does the scraping action, and main is the python file to run.

NOTE: This is not a complete version of the Scrapy-Redis project, since it only consists of my part (the master part) of the code. The slave part of the code is not shown here.
